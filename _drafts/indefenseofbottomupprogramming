A difficult part in programming is managing context. Big features in the middle of the app have a lot of context surrounding them for how they need to work. By starting from the smallest componenets in the bottom, the context is minimized, and they are eaiser to build. This is akin to first building the legos, and then using the building blocks to build the higher level abstractions.
