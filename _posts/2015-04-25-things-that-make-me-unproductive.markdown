## Things that make me unproductive

* Long meetings
* Having < 1hr before I know I need to stop for a meeting
* Slow build times
* Slow artifact uploads
* Bad internet connections
* Blockers
* Not enough work to do
* Unclear goals on what I need to accomplish that day/unclear acceptance criteria
* Unclear project scope
* Unclear design
* When no one is testing the builds
* When the PM doesn't test the builds - this sends the signal that the project is unimportant
* When the PM is out of the loop
* Low energy
* Having not enough caffine
* Not having a project to work on
* Only have tiny bug fix/pixel pushing work, and not a meaty feature to work on
* Working on uninportant features that no one will care to use
* Working on unimportant projects that no one will care to use
* Working late at night
* Waiting on feedback/code reviews
* Disheartening amounts of techdebt
* Slow unit tests
* No unit tests
* Reddit/Facebook/Quora/Hacker News distraction
* Too loud of an environment


## Things that tend to help

* Quiet area
* Music
* Lots of caffine
* Early in the morning before other distractions
* Having quick, well defined task to get started for the day (bug fix, visual polish)
* Daily status updates and daily time tracking
* And above all, believing that the project will be useful to others
